# :sparkles: Selection Sort :sparkles:

A simple, educational Python implementation of the **Selection Sort** algorithm.  
Selection Sort is an introductory sorting algorithm that:

- Repeatedly scans for the smallest element in the **unsorted** section  
- Swaps it with the leftmost **unsorted** element  
- Moves the boundary of the sorted section one step to the right  

Despite having a time complexity of \\( O(n^2) \\), it's easy to understand and implement, making it a great starting point for beginners in algorithmic studies.
